# Biography

I received my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from the Texas A&M University this Auguest. I am currently looking for a Ph.D. position. 

During my master's program, I had been a graduate Research Assistant at Genetic Signaling Processing lab for two years. My research mentor was Dr. Yang Shen. 

My research interests lie in designing computational models to decipher biological mechanisms in complex genetic diseases and explore novel clinical treatments.
